A simple desktop application to automate any key press, specifically designed to ease fatigue during long dialogue scenes in Dragon Quest X.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **Comprehensive Customization**:
    *   **Dual Key Assignment**: Assign a hotkey to start/stop the script, and separately assign the key you want to be pressed automatically.
    *   **Interval Control**: Select from a wide range of press intervals, including a "Random" mode. Faster, potentially risky intervals are clearly marked.
    *   **Press Limit**: Set a maximum number of key presses. The script will stop automatically once the limit is reached (set to 0 for infinite).
    *   **Humanization Mode**: Option to add random WASD inputs between presses.

*   **User-Friendly Interface**:
    *   **Light & Dark Modes**: Instantly switch between themes for your viewing comfort.
    *   **Multi-language Support**: Interface is fully available in English and Spanish.
    *   **Real-time Status Display**: Get live feedback on the script's status (Active/Stopped), the number of presses, and a countdown to the next press.
    *   **Sound Feedback**: Enable optional audio cues that play when the script starts and stops.
    *   **Informative Tooltips**: Hover over any control to get a clear explanation of its function.

*   **Configuration Management**:
    *   **Automatic Saving**: Your settings (including keys, interval, theme, and language) are automatically saved and reloaded the next time you open the application.
